# Simple Ecommerce
A simple eCommerce project that allows you to add or subtract units from stock depending on the transaction being performed.<br>
When a product is added to the cart, it is deducted from the initial stock, or when a product is removed from the cart, it is returned to the cart.<br>
The program does not allow you to purchase more products than are available in stock. Each time a product is added or subtracted from the cart, the total is modified.<br>
Images alluding to the product you wish to purchase are also displayed.<br>
A purchase is simulated by sending a thank you message.<br>
Each time the purchase is completed, the total and the number of items purchased are cleared.<br>
The containers for available items have a subtle transition.<br>
To access both: ID, Item Image, Name,Price, Units.<br>
An array is used and the information to be subtracted from or added to the stock is searched for using its ID.<br>
The document includes links to social media.<br>
